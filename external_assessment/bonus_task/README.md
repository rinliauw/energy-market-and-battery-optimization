## Directory
- `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb`: contains test data price predictions with VAR using log 
- `ARMA.ipynb`: contains test data price predictions using ARIMA

## Instructions
1. To predict prices using the final model, open the file `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb`.
3. Please make sure the file `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb` has output the predicted price into this directory: `VAR_predictions_log.xlsx`
2. To run the final chosen model for bonus task (VAR Model), open `Run Bonus Task.ipynb`. This will run the predicted price on the mandatory task's model.
