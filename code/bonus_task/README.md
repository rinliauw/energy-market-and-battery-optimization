## Directory
- `Vector Autoregression (Log Difference).ipynb`: contains test data price predictions with VAR using log difference transformation
- `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb`: contains test data price predictions with VAR using log 
- `ARIMA.ipynb`: contains test data price predictions using ARIMA

## Instructions
1. To predict prices using the final model, open the file `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb`.
2. To run the final chosen model for bonus task (VAR Model), open `Run VAR.ipynb`. This will run the predicted price on the mandatory task's model.
