## Bonus Task
### Directory
- `Run Bonus Task.ipynb`: notebook to run the mandatory task's algorithm onn predicted price obtained from `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb` 
- `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb`: contains test data price predictions with VAR using log 
- `ARMA.ipynb`: contains test data price predictions using ARIMA
- `MiniModels.ipynb`: contains all functions of the mini models to be run in the bonus task
- `OptimisationAlgs.ipynb`: contains all functions to run the main mandatory task algorithm (required for bonus task)

### Instructions
1. To predict prices using the final model, open the file `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb`.
2. To run the models for bonus task (VAR and ARMA Model), open `Run Bonus Task.ipynb`. This will run the predicted price on the mandatory task's algorithm.
3. Please make sure the file `Vector Autoregression (Log).ipynb` has output the predicted price into this directory: `../../prediction_data/VAR_predictions_log.xlsx`
