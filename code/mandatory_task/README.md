# Mandatory Task
## Directory
- `MiniModels.ipynb`: contains all functions of the mini models 
  -   `Moving Average`
  -   `Region Maximisation`
  -   `Loss Removal`
  -   `Stationary Maximisation`
  -   `Action Shift`
- `Battery.py`: Contains the battery class that is needed for `PeriodMaximisation.py`
- `PeriodMaximisation.py`: Period Maximisation model (MAKE SURE `Battery.py` IS IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THERE IS DEPENDENCIES TOWARDS IT).
- `Final Optimisation Algorithm.ipynb`: Main Function to run the optimisation algorithm (JUST USE THIS ONE, IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN BATTERY SPECIFICATIONS CHANGE IT IN THE THREE FILES ABOVE).

## Instructions
1. Make sure `MiniModels.ipynb`, `Battery.py`, `PeriodMaximisation.py` and `Final Optimisation Algorithm.ipynb` are in the same directory.
2. Open the `Final Optimisation Algorithm.ipynb`.
3. Read the instructions in `Final Optimisation Algorithm.ipynb`.
