As we can see for both ROCAs in the left table, the 2 best price points in each ROCAs are given the least amount of dispatches. This would decrease the total revenue in the final calculation. The RM model solves this by maximising each ROCAs based on their current capacities, action (charge/discharge) and most importantly, the prices. In other words, it allocates the best price points to the most dispatches. The table on the right shows how the dispatches move, when the RM model is applied."
